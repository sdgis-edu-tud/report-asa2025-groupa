## Introduction

#### **The case of Senica** 

Through the heart of the city of Senica (a Slovak city, close to the Czech border) flows the Teplica. Due to economic pressures the stream has been heavily altered and is rendered invisible and insignificant in the urban landscape. Currently the Teplica is struggling with several problems, like poor flood handling, poor morphological and ecological quality, low flow during dry periods, an upstream dam and poorly utilized public space (Škrinár, 2025). The city of Senica is taking steps towards the restoration of this stream serving as an exemplary project within the 'ReBioClim-project'. This EU-project aims to restore urban streams while focusing on both biodiversity, climate change and liveability in cities (City of Senica, 2024a). \
 \
While the Slovak water management company, SVP, focuses mainly on protecting the area against flooding due to heavy rainfall, more functional access to the water and improved water flow (City of Senica, 2024b), other focuses of the project include improving hydro morphology, ecology and diversity in urban areas and utilizing the stream for recreational purposes. Little attention is given to qualitative and experiential aspects such as human-nature connectedness. \
 \
In order to bridge this gap and ensure a lasting impact of the urban stream restoration, the enquiry in this report is focused on a way to determine potential for human-nature connectedness along the stream of Teplica. \
 

-   **Research Question :** What parts of the Teplica stream have the most potential for human-nature connectedness and to create a biophilic environment?  

#### **Human-nature connectedness and its relevance to urban stream restoration** 

Human-nature connectedness challenges the idea of human superiority over nature, while strengthening the outlook that humankind is a part of nature. Research has shown that this sense of connectedness cannot be created through education only (Spiller, 2024). Spatial composition plays an important role in this process where people must come into direct contact to build a strong relationship with their natural environments.   

A theory that has gained recognition in recent decades and is often associated with human-nature connectedness is the biophilia hypothesis (Bhaskar, 2023; Lefosse et al., 2023). This hypothesis states that humans have an innate tendency to seek connections to nature (Grinde & Patil, 2009; Wilson, 1984). This connection is supported with evidence from multiple different fields of study (Grinde & Patil, 2009). The results from several of these studies show a strong connection between human-nature connectedness and an increased human health and wellbeing. This connection is not just physical, but also cognitive, emotional and biophysical (Ives et al., 2017).  

Biophilic design, based on the biophilia hypothesis focuses on reinforcing the relationship between humans and the natural world through the creation or strengthening of biophilic places (Da Silva et al., 2021). Human-nature connectedness forms the starting point of this approach. It proposes to utilize green infrastructure to improve ecosystem health and human wellbeing. These places have shown great potential in different ways. They increase social interaction, as people view them as places of improved livability and sociability (Lefosse et al., 2023). Biophilic places also strengthen social cohesion, as they positively influence the perceived social cohesion, as well as facilitating more (semi-)social activities that strengthen community bonds. Another important effect of biophilic places, and the subsequent increase in regular experiences of nature, is that they raise environmental awareness and encourage a more sustainable way of living. Furthermore, on the long term biophilia can aid ecosystem conservation efforts (Bhaskar, 2023). People who are connected to nature and have a strong relationship to nature are more likely to participate in more sustainable behavior and to support ecosystem and biodiversity conservation efforts.   

By determining how biophilic a place is, we can derive how much it improves the human-nature connectedness of the people living around it or visiting it. A biophilic place has a great impact on the people living around it, while a place that is not biophilic lacks this character. By determining the amount of biophilic integration, we can show which places have the largest need for improvement and which places are already performing well. 

#### **How does biodiversity affect human-nature connectedness?** 

While biophilic integration mainly focusses on connecting people to nature, the importance of biodiversity cannot be overlooked (Lefosse et al., 2023). Streams are complex ecosystems and all the different present species contribute to the complex system that is this ecosystem (Bhaskar, 2023). Biodiversity therefore is of vital importance in protecting this ecosystem from collapse. In assessing the need for change in the areas around streams, it is therefore important to also look at indicators for biodiversity and ecosystem functionality. 

By analysing biodiversity, we can determine where the creation or dedication of ecological networks is most necessary. So that they can provide more ecosystem services (Lefosse et al., 2023; Ranta et al., 2021a). Biophilic integration has shown great potential in reinforcing urban biomes that can act as biodiversity incubators through an increase in natural repopulation of plant and animal species (Bhaskar, 2023; Panlasigui et al., 2021).  

#### **How does microclimate affect human-nature connectedness?** 

Another way in which biodiversity and biophilic integration are linked is through microclimate ecosystem services (Lefosse et al., 2023). The amount of biophilic integration relies on the ecosystem services a local ecosystem can provide. Reinforcing ecological networks, increases ecosystem functionality and therefore the amount of biophilic integration. By having more diverse natural elements, both green and blue, containing multiple different species, the environmental impact of a place is enhanced. Different species have different cooling, air-, soil- and water purification, and wind regulating properties. With these species working together, and sometimes even positively affecting the properties of other species, their impact can grow even further. The more biodiverse a place is, the more biophilic it can be, and the more it can improve human-nature connectedness. By analyzing the performance of the existing microclimate we can again determine where action is needed most.  

## Methods

### MCDA

#### Units

#### Criteria

For the MCDA, the analyses are split into three main categories: quality of life, biodiversity and climate change. For each category a couple of analyses are done that give an indication of the human-nature connectedness around the stream. Based on that we can give an indication of where change is needed the most to improve this relationship. 

##### Biodiversity

To determine the amount of biodiversity of the area around the stream we are focusing on three aspects. The first two of those are related to the theory of island biogeography (MacArthur & Wilson, 2001). It states that the larger a green area is, the more biodiverse it will be (Conor & McCoy, 2013). This green area size is determined by two factors: the size of a single continuous green area and the interconnectivity between green areas. To determine the potential biodiversity around the stream, we are analyzing the percentage of green space around the stream, giving us an indication of the size of the green area. And we are analyzing the connectivity between the green areas. After analyzing this, we are also looking into the presence of different species in the area around the stream, as this gives us a more reliable indication of the actual biodiversity that is currently present.

###### **Biodiversity 1** \| Percentage of green

The criterion used in this analysis is based on the Biophilic Planning Indicator (source to be added). The ratio of green space to total area serves as a proxy for assessing the amount of natural habitat near the Teplica stream. This method is also effective for comparing natural conditions across different spatial units.

To calculate this ratio, the buffer distance is a crucial factor. A buffer of 500 meters was applied, as this range effectively includes most of the surrounding green spaces. Green areas within this 500m buffer were intersected with the buffered spatial units, and a new column was created to represent the amount of green space within each unit.

This green area value was then joined to the buffer layer, enabling the calculation of the green-to-total-area ratio for each unit. The result, expressed as a percentage, is shown in the image below:

(image to be inserted here)

Since the green space percentages range approximately from 0% to 30%, the data was categorized into ten equal intervals, each representing a 3% range. A normalized value was also calculated using the formula.

> Normalized value = (Percentage of green)/30

To create a normalized map for each stream unit, the line layer representing the Teplica stream was intersected with the buffered layer containing green area percentages. The corresponding values were then normalized using the formula above. The final map representing the green space percentage per unit is shown below:

(image to be inserted here)

However, this approach may not fully reflect the habitability for different species. The total size of contiguous green spaces might be more significant than the mere percentage within a buffer. A potential improvement would be to assign ecological value or rank to each green space patch and create a new indicator that reflects both the quality and amount of green space intersecting each unit.

###### **Biodiversity 1** \| Distance to green

Apart from the amount of green space, the proximity of green space to the stream is also an important factor. Even if there is a considerable area of green space, it becomes difficult to associate it with the stream if it is located too far away. This is especially critical for small animals such as frogs, for which direct connection between the stream and nearby natural areas is essential.

To address this, distance to green space is introduced as an additional criterion alongside the percentage of green area. While the percentage of green reflects the amount of natural habitat, the distance represents the connectivity between the stream and nearby green areas.

In this case, no buffer is needed, as the stream line itself serves as the reference for calculating distance. Using the processing tool (tool name to be added), the shortest distance from each stream unit to the nearest green space was calculated, based on the green space and Teplica stream layers.

Since longer distances indicate lower connectivity, this serves as a negative indicator. For normalization, the distance values were divided into ten quantile-based groups, meaning each group contains approximately the same number of units. A reversed score from 1.0 (closest) to 0.1 (farthest) was then assigned to each group. The group boundaries were slightly adjusted to better highlight differences between them. The resulting classification of stream units based on distance to the nearest green space is shown below:

(image to be inserted here)

By assigning reversed scores to each group, the normalized distance-based connectivity value for each unit is shown as follows:

(image to be inserted here)

However, this normalization method may need reconsideration. Since increased distance can result in significantly reduced connectivity, a different calculation approach may better capture this effect. One alternative is to use the following function:

> Normalized value = 1 / (distance to nearest green space)

To apply this formula, a distance of 0 must first be converted to 1 (or a small positive value) to avoid division errors. This approach may provide a more accurate representation of ecological connectivity between the stream and surrounding green spaces.

###### Biodiversity 3 \| Presence of species 

It is worth noting that the presence of ecological corridors near or within urban areas, is one of the important things in biophilic cities (source to be added). Species present in the are a direct indicator of the presence of varied habitats and ecological areas in the city. The findings from these could then be used to find areas lacking biodiversity in order to improve diversity in these areas. 

A buffer of 2km is applied to this criterion considering the movement of fauna, which includes mammals and reptiles. This buffer area also includes parts of forest surrounding the east of Senica. Data on a total of 9 distinct faunal species (sourced from the Slovak atlas) was merged to form a layer containing count of each of the species. This was intersected with the spatial buffer to count the number of distinct species in each buffer unit. 9 indicates the highest diversity whereas 5 is the lowest count for diversity of species per unit. 

![Biodiversity 3 \| Presence of species : Buffer of 2km](images/species numbers.png)

Normalise value = (max count – min count)/ min count 

The range of species count is classifed into ten quantile-based groups to maintain homogenity while comparing with other criteria. A score of 0 – 1.0 is assigned to each group ranging from lowest biodiversity count to the highest. The resulting classification is shown below.
