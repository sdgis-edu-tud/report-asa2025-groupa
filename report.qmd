::: callout
## This is a computational notebook

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

You can delete this entire callout between and including the lines

```         
::: callout
```

and

```

##### Biodiversity

To determine the amount of biodiversity of the area around the stream we are focusing on three aspects. The first two of those are related to the theory of island biogeography (MacArthur & Wilson, 2001). It states that the larger a green area is, the more biodiverse it will be (Conor & McCoy, 2013). This green area size is determined by two factors: the size of a single continuous green area and the interconnectivity between green areas. To determine the potential biodiversity around the stream, we are analyzing the percentage of green space around the stream, giving us an indication of the size of the green area. And we are analyzing the connectivity between the green areas. After analyzing this, we are also looking into the presence of different species in the area around the stream, as this gives us a more reliable indication of the actual biodiversity that is currently present.

###### **Biodiversity 1** \| Percentage of green

The criterion used in this analysis is based on the Biophilic Planning Indicator (source to be added). The ratio of green space to total area serves as a proxy for assessing the amount of natural habitat near the Teplica stream. This method is also effective for comparing natural conditions across different spatial units.

To calculate this ratio, the buffer distance is a crucial factor. A buffer of 500 meters was applied, as this range effectively includes most of the surrounding green spaces. Green areas within this 500m buffer were intersected with the buffered spatial units, and a new column was created to represent the amount of green space within each unit.

This green area value was then joined to the buffer layer, enabling the calculation of the green-to-total-area ratio for each unit. The result, expressed as a percentage, is shown in the image below:

Since the green space percentages range approximately from 0% to 30%, the data was categorized into ten equal intervals, each representing a 3% range. A normalized value was also calculated using the formula: \>Normalized Value = (Green Area Percentage) / 30

To create a normalized map for each stream unit, the line layer representing the Teplica stream was intersected with the buffered layer containing green area percentages. The corresponding values were then normalized using the formula above. The final map representing the green space percentage per unit is shown below:

However, this approach may not fully reflect the habitability for different species. The total size of contiguous green spaces might be more significant than the mere percentage within a buffer. A potential improvement would be to assign ecological value or rank to each green space patch and create a new indicator that reflects both the quality and amount of green space intersecting each unit.
